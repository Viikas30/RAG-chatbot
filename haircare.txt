Straight hair is the most common hair type and the easiest to maintain. Wavy hair lies between straight and curly hair as they form natural soft curls. Curly hair has more prominent loop-like curls throughout the lengths. And lastly, kinky or coily hair has tight spring-like coils throughout.

Hair Care 101: Simple and Effective Tips for Every Hair Type 
1. Shampoo 
Cleansing your scalp and hair is the first step in a hair care routine. This helps remove excess dirt, oil and product build up, and creates a healthy environment for the hair to thrive.  

Straight Hair: Use a clarifying shampoo for straight hair as they retain more oil and can get greasy and limp if not washed properly.

Wavy Hair: Use moisturising or hydrating shampoos as wavy hair tends to be drier than straight hair. Look for products specifically designed for wavy hair to provide the necessary moisture and nourishment. To add strength to your dry strands, use Dove Healthy Ritual for Strengthening Hair Shampoo. This shampoo is infused with the goodness of oat milk and honey and helps in repair damage and prevents hair breakage. 

Curly / Kinky Hair: Sulphates in shampoos strip off the natural oils and make them dry. Since, curly hair is naturally dry and frizzy, sulphates can do more harm than good. Opt for sulphate-free shampoos with hydrating, plant-based ingredients to retain moisture in the hair.

Curly hair is more prone to breakage and tangles and requires moisturising ingredients to grow hair and control hair fall. We recommend using Dove Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair Shampoo. Enriched with natural ingredients like coneflower, oil and white tea which are known de-stressors, helps nourish hair and reach its natural growth potential. There are no added parabens and dyes in this shampoo. 

2. Conditioner

Simple and Effective Tips for Every Hair Type | Top 7 Tips

Straight Hair: Look for lightweight formulas as they are designed to provide moisture and nourishment without leaving a heavy or greasy residue on the hair. For fine or limp straight hair, consider using volumizing conditioners. Stay away from heavy, oil-based or overly creamy conditioners as these can weigh down the hair, making it look flat. 

Wavy Hair: Opt for conditioners that offer deep hydration to combat the natural dryness of wavy hair. Look for ingredients like argan oil and shea butter that help prevent frizz. Frizz leaves the hair tangled and unmanageable. The new Dove Healthy Ritual for Strengthening Hair Conditioner repairs and nourishes the hair. The formula reduces frizz and controls flyaways, and is suitable for all hair types.   

Curly / Kinky Hair: Moisturising conditioner and leave-in conditioner is a must for curly hair type. Since curly hair is highly frizzy and entangles easily, it is more prone to breakage. It requires hydrating conditioner that helps retain moisture and eases the process of detangling, thus minimising breakage. Apply leave-in conditioner suitable for curly hair to lock in the moisture.   

3. Hair Mask 
A hair mask is a deep conditioning treatment to provide intense nourishment, moisture and repair to the hair. It is usually formulated for hair concerns such as dryness, damage and frizz. 

Simple and Effective Tips for Every Hair Type | Top 7 Tips

Straight Hair: Choose a lightweight, moisturising hair mask that contain ingredients like keratin and light oils that strengthen the hair shaft. Avoid heavy, creamy masks that might flatten your hair. 

Wavy Hair: Look for curl or wave enhancing properties that boost the natural texture and shape of your waves. Wavy hair like curly hair is prone to frizz. Ingredients like olive oil and glycerin can help with frizz control.  

Curly / Kinky Hair: Curly hair craves moisture, and deep conditioning mask will provide that intense hydration to keep the hair shiny and nourished. Choose a hair mask that provides repairing and strengthening benefits as curly hair is susceptible to damage and breakage. For smooth and manageable hair, we recommend deep conditioning with Dove Healthy Ritual for Strengthening Hair Mask. Divide wet hair into sections. Distribute the product evenly into the hair. Leave the mask on for three to five minutes or more.    

4. Oiling 
For any hair type, oiling helps in adding shine and protecting the hair shaft. It is one of the most trusted hair care methods used in India for centuries.

Straight Hair: Using light and non-greasy oil is well-suited for straight hair. Oils like argan, jojoba, grapeseed and almond oil can easily be absorbed in straight hair without weighing it down.   

Wavy Hair: Oils rich in essential fats will help lock in the moisture and enhance shine in wavy hair. Olive oil, almond oil, virgin coconut oil and castor oil work well for wavy hair. If you’re looking for an ayurvedic oil, we recommend using Indulekha Bringha Ayurvedic Oil. Enriched with bhringraj and 10 other herbs, this ayurvedic oil revives your roots to grow new hair. For best results, use three times a week.  

Curly / Kinky Hair: Curly hair doesn’t hold moisture well causing breakage and split ends. Oils can nourish, moisturise, strengthen and bring back the curls back to life. Curly hair needs oils that soothe the scalp such as peppermint oil and rosemary oil that have anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant properties. Oiling can also help with detangling as it provides great slip and minimises hair breakage. 

5. Combing  
Combing helps in removing knots and stimulates the scalp promoting a healthier scalp environment to support hair growth.

Straight Hair: Combing helps distribute the natural oils produced by the scalp along the hair shaft, providing moisture and nourishment. It aligns the hair strands, reduces static electricity and frizz by smoothing the hair cuticles. 

Wavy Hair: Gentle combing helps with detangling and maintaining natural wave pattern. To minimise frizz and making detangling easier, wavy hair is best combed when it is slightly damp. Avoid over-combing as it can disrupt the wave pattern and cause frizz. 

Curly / Kinky Hair: It is highly advisable to comb or detangle curly hair in the shower while applying conditioner. Either opt for a wide-toothed comb or embrace finger combing to detangle curly hair. Start from the ends and gradually work up towards the roots. Always avoid dry combing curly hair.

Regular haircuts or trims reduce split ends, minimises frizz and adds definition to the hair. It also helps in framing the face and helps experimenting with different hairstyles.
